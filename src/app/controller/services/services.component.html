                  <h6>REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS</h6>
                    <p>
                      This phase involves gathering and analyzing the needs and specifications for an industrial automation project. It includes understanding the objectives, constraints, and functionalities desired by the client or end-user. The outcome is a detailed requirements document that serves as a blueprint for the project.</p>

                  <h6>Design and Documentation</h6>
                    <p>
                      In this stage, engineers and designers translate the requirements into a detailed design. This encompasses creating schematics, diagrams, and specifications for the automation system. Documentation involves documenting every aspect of the design, including components, interfaces, and operational procedures, ensuring clarity and accuracy throughout the project lifecycle.</p>

                    <p>
                      During this phase, the assembled automation system is installed, integrated, and tested at the client's site. Erection involves physically setting up the components, while commissioning involves configuring and fine-tuning the system to ensure it meets performance requirements. This phase concludes with the system being ready for operation.</p>

                  <h6>Breakdown and Maintenance</h6>
                    <p>
                      After the system is operational, ongoing maintenance is essential to ensure its continued performance and reliability. This includes preventive maintenance to minimize the risk of breakdowns as well as reactive maintenance to address any unexpected failures promptly. Regular inspections, troubleshooting, and repairs are part of this ongoing process to keep the automation system running smoothly.</p>
